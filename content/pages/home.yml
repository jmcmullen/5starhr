    We can be engaged as an HR consultant to deliver a single project, such as a
    new employee management system designed to automate all your employee
    record-keeping or through to acting as your outsourced HR Manager on a
    retained basis. We can also just help out on an ad hoc basis by providing
    advice and support as required in relation to any HR issue – whether its
    basic HR advice on employee entitlements and Award interpretation to more
    complex situations involving restructures, redundancies or unfair dismissal
    claims.
